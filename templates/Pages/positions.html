One facet of the complexity of life is the cascade of signaling caused by thousands of proteins transferring unambiguous signals that instantly will regulate production and activities in the cell at the molecular level. Signal transfer initiated at the membrane is completed in the nucleus by the action of transcription factors and is conveyed through protein-protein interactions involving disordered regions. The PhD student will investigate the order-disorder cross-talk in the context of full-length transcription factors and how this cross-talk mediates regulation of transcription. By application of NMR spectroscopy and a suite of biophysical techniques we seek to map mechanisms of disorder-order crosstalk in transcription factors." %}

Systasy’s barcoding technology uses molecular barcodes to track different entities within one experiment. These entities include activities of targets and cellular pathways, cell types and patient material, as well as technical features such as biological replicates, wells, and plates. When applied to next-generation stem cell-derived disease models, Systasy’s barcoded and cell-based profiling assays enable multiplexed and scalable drug screening in early-stage drug discovery." %}

In particular, we focus on systems with pronounced conformational heterogeneity that is difficult to resolve with other techniques. Examples are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), protein-nucleic acid interactions, protein misfolding, or the behavior of proteins inside live cells. A key goal of our work is to reach mechanistic understanding based on quantitative physical models. <br> Addressing these questions requires a broad spectrum of complementary methods, and thus a multidisciplinary team of scientists from physics, chemistry, and biology who closely collaborate within the group. We use an integrative approach ranging from molecular biology and protein chemistry to a wide range of biophysical methods, single-molecule spectroscopies, and simulations. An important component of our research is the continuous development of single-molecule techniques and analysis methods for probing biological macromolecules over a wide range of conditions and timescales."  %}
